# Visualization_Charlotte_NC_Mecklenburg_County_Violent_Crimes_with_Tableau
Analyzed data on Violent Crimes and Traffic Stops, highlighted geographic and demographic trends and proposed some possible cost effective solutions such as automation. The focus of the project was not about using crime data to find the causes of crime, but rather to point out cost effective solutions. 

## Introduction / Overview
- Analyzed data on Violent Crimes and Traffic Stops, highlighted geographic and demographic trends and proposed some possible cost effective solutions such as automation.
  
### Message in the data - the project is about story-telling with Tableau as a tool.
- The Sugar Creek/1-85 and Nations Ford Arrowood areas are hotspots, showing high numbers of violent crimes.
- Aggravated assault with guns and domestic violence, have been on the increase.
- Victims are mostly young adults, rising to people in their early 40’s. 

### A Focused Approach: (Charlotte City can achieve violent crimes control, cost efficiently)
- Analysis of the reasons for traffic stops and the result of traffic stops are quite revealing.
- Rebalance police activities to focus more on violent crimes.

### Addressing Counter-arguments: 
- Rebalanced efforts should lead to crime reduction and cost-effective policing.
- Use of crime data is not necessarily about finding the causes of crime, but rather to point out cost effective solutions. To emphasize, police effort today is not the cause. It should be part of the solutions.

### Conclusion & Recommendations:
- A review of the analysis and findings – to inform how a hypothetical mayoral campaign might be positioned on the topic of violent crimes reduction.

## Geographical Pointers, and Violent Crime Types

Mayoral campaign on a theme to work to reduce violent crimes, appears to be well founded:
- All areas of Charlotte covered by the mayorship should benefit from refocusing of Police efforts (to be covered in slide 6)
- However, two areas are significant hotspots for violent crimes – the Sugar Creek/1-85 and Nations Ford Arrowood areas
- The past 3 years (2020-2022) have seen jumps in reported domestic violence compared the prior 3-year period.
- Addressing guns-related aggravated assaults, on an 8-year high, should be one of the key focus of the mayoral campaign.

## Demographical Views: Victims of Crime

Identifying victims of crime could be a useful first step:
- Victims are mostly in their primes – young adults, rising to people in their early 40’s.
- The victims of crime breakdown by race does not favor the Black population.
- Men perpetuate more violent crimes than women and are also more likely to be victims of violent crimes.
- Having a plan to address such as campaigning on community outreach programs, including local police engagement within the crime hotspot areas, is likely to resonate well if specific groups are called out, as the data is demanding.

## Opportunity to Automate Traffic Enforcement, and Refocus Police Effort

Introducing legislation and then implementing effective technology:
 - In today’s digital age, effective technology1 can be deployed to augment and relieve police resources dedicated to making traffic stops that evidently result in verbal or written warnings, most of the time. 
- Experienced police officers, currently dedicated to making traffic stops, can attend to rising violent crimes.

The capital expenditure entailed on technology, should be milder on the budget, compared to increasing the size of the police force. The case here is not to stop altogether police traffic activities, but to leverage technology to refocus police manpower.

## The Data Speaks: Possible Counter-points

### Data Limitations: 
- Although the datasets were of high quality in terms no nulls and missing values, drawing conclusions should be nuanced. 
- Arguments that the inferences drawn were faulty, can be countered by (a) showing that some statistics have remained flat or trended downward and (b) therefore where the trends are bad or alarming, these should not be ignored.
- And of course, correlation is not equal to causation.

### Rebalancing police effort: 
- Analysis of traffic stops data is not an attempt to downplay traffic offenses. 
- Sooner rather than later, CMPD needs to move to the digital age. For example, by introducing and/or extending the use of modern electronic enforcement approaches. This is supported by “result-of-stop” data.
  
### Data points called out:
- Calling out violent crime hotspot areas is not an attempt to ‘label’ but to declare areas and zones where more helps are needed. The objective is to lift safety levels for all citizens and all communities.
- The same as the immediate point above, will apply to victims of crime analysis by age and race.

## Conclusion

- Key Takeaway - A lot of work is required before going on a campaign trail and before drawing conclusions from data.
- Obtain data on population metrics and costs of introducing/extending use of technology in say, traffic enforcement.
- Confirm the legislative process involved in changing/extending traffic enforcement.
